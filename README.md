# Ending the Payday Loan Scam
## A *Better Fi*ght to Predatory Lending

For millions of Americans with bad credit, taking out a loan means paying **400% or higher APR to a lender**, trapping clients in debt for years.

### How Can BetterFi Help?
BetterFi is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation that promotes economic justice and offers low interest rates to help individuals get out of debt. They are looking for a data-driven method to evaluate and enhance their lending decisions. Based on historical BetterFi data, the DataLab team will create a risk assessment tool that can calculate default risk based on applicant data.

### The Dashboard
The Predictive Model tab allows for our client to input new client's details to generate a prediction of whether or not they will pay in full or charge off. 

The Data Analytics tab is broken down into  Demographics, Income and Expenses, and Loan Details, that shows significant trends that influence the probability of repayment as well as the relationship between variables and loan repayment.
