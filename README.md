# A Better Fight to Predatory Lending

## Problem Statement:

BetterFi is a nonprofit company that offers lower interest rates to help
combat title and payday predatory lending schemes. BetterFi needs a method to
make more accurate lending forecasts to help low-income households get out of
debt. We will develop a model that will generate a loan repayment score to
quantify payment reliability and reduce delinquency rates which will aid in the
automation of the procedure and the distribution of more loans to help end the
cycle of debt.
