# Ending the Payday Loan Scam
## A *Better Fi*ght to Predatory Lending

For millions of Americans with bad credit, taking out a loan means paying **400% or higher APR to a lender**, trapping clients in debt for years.

### How Can BetterFi Help?
BetterFi is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation that promotes economic justice and offers low interest rates to help individuals get out of debt. They are looking for a data-driven method to evaluate and enhance their lending decisions. Based on historical BetterFi data, the DataLab team will create a risk assessment tool that can calculate default risk based on applicant data.
